.Sh NAME 
.Nm network-irq-affinity
.Nd Set CPU affinity for network interface IRQs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hnv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sets the CPU affinity of IRQs attached to network interfaces and
network interface queues. The IRQs will be distributed across all the CPUs
in an efficient manner.
.Pp
The default CPU affinity configuration with many network drivers is to
either schedule all IRQs to CPU 0, or across all CPUs. The former can
overload the CPU, while the latter can suffer from CPU memory cache
misses. Both cases can result in sub-par network performance.
.Pp
The following options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl h
Display a usage message, explaining these options.
.It Fl n
Do not make any changes to the system. This implies
.Fl v .

Produce verbose output.
